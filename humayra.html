    <p>Cows are 4-legged animals that are herbivorous. They feed on plants. They are big animals that can reach a height of 3-4 feet. We get plenty of food products from cows like milk, cheese, yogurt, fat, etc. They are mammals who give birth to young ones. The babies of cows are known as calves. There are many varieties of cows; some of them have white, plain skin, while others have a spotted body. Most of the cows have thick coats that are 4-layers deep. Cows are of great importance to man. We are dependent on them for plenty of products without which we cannot imagine our lives.</p>

    <p>Cows are herbivorous animals that feed on grasses and plants. Their bodies are large, because of which they have enormous weights. To support this weight, cows’ legs have hooves that have been made secure due to keratin in them. This allows them to walk correctly. We need cows for many purposes like food, clothes, and cosmetics. In food, cows provide us with milk, cheese, butter, and meat. They are terrestrial mammals and give birth to young ones known as calves. Cows are diurnal animals and usually sleep at night. They have a great metabolism and require a lot of nutrition per day. The food of cows is referred to as fodder. Cows are kept in farms where they are needed for providing milk. These are sensitive animals and need a clean and dry place for staying. Plenty of large farms provide them with proper hygienic conditions to live in and take care of their nutrition.</p>
