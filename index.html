    <p> The lion is a powerful animal with a powerful physique, a large head with a majestic mane, four legs, and two brilliant eyes. Lions are carnivorous animals that only eat after they have hunted. They have powerful claws and sharp teeth that enable them to hunt and consume flesh. Lions have yellow-grey skin and sleek hair, and their roar distinguishes them from other animals. Pug marks refer to a lion’s footprints. Lions are usually found in open woodlands, grasslands, or zoos. They can sprint extremely quickly as they kill their prey and search for sustenance. Lions are found in groups known as pride, where only two adult lions are found, and the rest are lionesses and their cubs. Lions are very protective when it comes to their cubs and their places. They fight for their survival and can fight for their families.
